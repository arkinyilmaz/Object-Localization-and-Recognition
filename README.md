# Object-Localization-and-Recognition
Image classification and object recognition is a big matter in computer vision and finding a suitable model for this purpose is a rather expensive process. This project aims to define the usability and reliability of an image analysis and machine learning model, particularly a model which uses a region-based convolutional neural network(RCNN) for feature extraction and multiple binary support vector machine(SVM) for classification. At the end of the project, it can be seen that this model is in fact surely reliable, on the other hand time-consuming.
